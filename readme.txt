This is a planning application that assists a student to plan their path through the
B.Comp program. The application will keep track of student progress through the program,
assist with planning the courseload for each semester, and help the student determine if 
they have fulfilled the requirements to graduate.

The application uses four csv formatted files called bcgReq, seReq, csReq and availableCourses. The file availableCourses consists of all the courses available to the B.Comp student.
The other three files consist of the requisites for each respective degree.

In order to run the program, please run it through eclipse or Terminal by running the Bootstrap.java and Planner.java file.

PS:
It is not conventional but please name the csv file in that exact manner. As for Option 2, I chose to get the required courses for the three degrees in three SEPARATE FILES. Please have a separate required
courses file for each major. So please name them exactly in this manner: "bcgReq.txt", "seReq.txt", "csReq.txt". And the first word of each file is BCG, CS, OR SE. So bcgReq.txt would have "BCG,CIS*1500,CIS...". Option 3 creates a saved file using the univ class.

For Planner, Options 2,3,4,5 and 6 work how they are supposed to. Option 14 is for exiting the program.
